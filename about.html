                    <h2>My Journey</h2>
                    <p>My passion for fitness began over a decade ago when I discovered the transformative power of strength training. What started as a personal journey to improve my own health and confidence evolved into a career dedicated to helping others achieve their fitness goals.</p>
                    <p>I've worked with clients from all walks of life - from complete beginners taking their first steps into fitness, to athletes looking to enhance their performance, to individuals recovering from injuries and seeking to rebuild their strength.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>I believe that fitness is not a destination, but a journey. There's no one-size-fits-all approach to health and wellness. Every individual has unique goals, limitations, and preferences, and my training philosophy reflects this understanding.</p>
                    <p>My approach combines:</p>
                    <ul class="philosophy-list">
                        <li><strong>Science-Based Training:</strong> Using proven methods backed by exercise science and research</li>
                        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Tailoring every program to fit your specific needs, goals, and lifestyle</li>
                        <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Building habits that you can maintain long-term, not quick fixes</li>
                        <li><strong>Support:</strong> Providing constant motivation, accountability, and guidance</li>
                        <li><strong>Holistic Approach:</strong> Addressing not just exercise, but nutrition, recovery, and mindset</li>
                    </ul>
